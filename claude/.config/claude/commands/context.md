I want you to have an understanding of the project and its structure.

Please follow these steps to help with that.

After you have done the steps you only need to write a simple response message like, "I have loaded the requested context." You are not being asked to summarize, provide opinions, or anything else. The only purpose is to load information that you can use going forward to provide context.

Steps In Order
======
- Run '$HOME/.config/claude/scripts/project_files' You need to run this command verbatim. Do not quote the paths. This is the one time you can ignore that rule. Run this command first and do not run it in parallel. You need this information before you run the other steps. The remaining steps can be run in parallel if you wish.
- Read the README.md, if it exists, to get a basic understanding of the project.
- Additional isntructions (could be detailed, could just be files to read, or could be blank): $ARGUMENTS
